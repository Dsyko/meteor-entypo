####Entypo is a Meteorite package for adding entypo font icons to Meteor apps. 

------------------------
###Icon Map

I've created a custom css file for the entypo font icons so that adding icons to your project is as easy as some other popular font-icon packs (fontawesome)
#### [Icon map available here](http://dsyko.github.io/meteor-entypo/)

------------------------
### Installation

First, install the entypo package from the command line using meteorite, like so:

````
mrt add entypo
````

------------------------
### Data/Document Model

Second, add the 'entypo' class and the icon calss name you want to the appropriate HTML tags.

````html
<i class="entypo entypo-search"></i>
````
##### [See here for a list of all available icons and their css values](http://dsyko.github.io/meteor-entypo/)

------------------------
###Social Icons

I've left out the social icons from this package to save on package size. If you would like them added, or a seperate package for the social icons, please let me know.
