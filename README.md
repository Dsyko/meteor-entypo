#**meteor-entypo** is a Meteorite package for adding Entypo font icons to Meteor apps. 

### I've created a custom css file for the entypo font icons so that adding icons to your project is as easy as some other popular font-icon packs (fontawesome)
### [See here for an icon map](http://dsyko.github.io/meteor-entypo/)

First, install the entypo package from the command line using meteorite, like so:
